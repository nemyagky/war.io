Main branch is empty. The code is in refactoring and playground branches.

Playground branch: rendering 2 million Three.js squares in 60fps
Refactoring branch: A game, where your troops are fighting vs another player troops, using socket.io (you need war.io-server running and to open second tab). Actually, you just have 10x100 squares. You can rotate and move them to diffrent place (they're always positioned in the 18th century style, straight line). If there's enemy troops near - each solder will find the best enemy to attack ```I'm using quadtree for that```


I can't deploy it cause npm build command is not working and I'm kinda lazy to fix webpack configs
